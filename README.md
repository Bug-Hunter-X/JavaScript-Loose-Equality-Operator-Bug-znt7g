This repository contains a simple JavaScript program that demonstrates a common bug caused by the loose equality operator (==). The program defines a function foo that takes two arguments, a and b. The function returns true if a is equal to 1 and b is equal to 2, and false otherwise. However, the function uses the loose equality operator, which performs type coercion. This means that the function will return true if a is equal to 1 and b is loosely equal to 2, even if b is not of the same type as 2. For example, the function will return true if b is the string "2". This can lead to unexpected results if you are not careful. The solution to this bug is to use the strict equality operator (===) instead of the loose equality operator. The strict equality operator does not perform type coercion, so it will only return true if a and b are of the same type and have the same value.  This example highlights the importance of understanding the difference between the loose and strict equality operators in JavaScript.
